What is Gaussai?
-------------

Gaussai is an experimental digital currency that enables instant, private
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Gaussai uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Gaussai Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.
